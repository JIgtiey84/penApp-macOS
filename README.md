# penApp For macOS
## how to open the program
To run the app:
1) Control+click on the app file (penApp in the same folder as this document) and select "Open".
2) If a warning appears, select "Open" if it's an option.
3) If a warning appears but "Open" isn't an option, press "Cancel" and repeat from step 1.
   The open button will appear the second time the warning appears.

After completing these steps, the app should run without any further warnings.

Feel free to drag the app into your Applications folder.

This is made in [_**Scratch**_](https://scratch.mit.edu) by the way.
